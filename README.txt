TicTacToe Java program

Created by: Adam Joseph Bogush AKA "Inferjus" with Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

	Hello! This Java program lets you play Tic Tac Toe with another person!

	It randomly chooses who will begin the round - X or O.

	It counts points gaines by the players and shows the result of each round.

	It also notifies the players who is supposed to make move at each moment.

	To clean the game board and remove all X and O marks, press "Refresh" button.
	This button becomes pressable when the round is finished.

	To set all scores to 0 and set default colours to game tiles (more on that later), press "Reset" button.
	This button becomes pressable when specific toggle button is pressed in "Options" tab.
	It deactivates after you press it or after you toggle off the button from "Options tab".

	This program has two tabs - "Game" and "Options.
	"Game" tab is the tab in which you can play the game. It contains all options mentioned earlier.
	In "Options" tab you can choose colours for X and O marks and their background colours.
	You can also toggle on and off "Restart" button by pressing "Reset is OFF/ON" toggle button.

	Have fun!
